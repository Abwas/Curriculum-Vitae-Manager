Wanted to be able to generate a good looking CV dynamic from a XML file. So I can just update the XML file and the script would output the CV in a PDF format. 

Requirements:
-> PySide (http://www.pyside.org/)

Using the Script:
The script can be run by supplying the data xml file and the output file.

If the output file is a html file the script will output a single .html file.
Else if the output filename has .pdf extension or does not match any of the other the script will produce a .pdf using WebKit. (Black Magic huh :D)

The Command syntax:

python cv.py example.xml CV.pdf
or
python cv.py example.xml CV.html

Used:
-> PySide (http://www.pyside.org/)
-> Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

Enjoy, this is one of my little side projects so I work on it when I have time. Could use your help if you have a idea.
